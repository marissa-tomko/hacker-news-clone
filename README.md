# Hacker News Clone

## Description
This is a project I worked on during my time at Dev Bootcamp. I completed it in order to show my skills in the following areas:

  - Use the MVC pattern in web applications with proper allocation of code and
  - responsibilities to each layer
  - Implement CRUD in an MVC application
  - Implement user login and authentication in a web application

I designed the flow to be similar to Hacker News (exception: comments are not threaded).

## Wireframe

1. An index page listing all the posts
2. A page showing a particular post, including comments
3. A user profile page
4. A page showing all a user's submissions
5. A page showing all a user's comments
6. A user signup and login page
